/*
  Supabase Edge Function scaffold (Deno)

  NOTE: this file is a DENO/Edge function example. The repository TypeScript
  checker used in this workspace will attempt to type-check files and may
  flag Deno-specific imports (e.g. 'std/server') as errors. To avoid that,
  keep the production Deno function source outside of the Node/TS compile
  path or deploy from a separate functions folder when using the Supabase
  CLI.

  This file is left intentionally as documentation and a scaffold. To deploy
  the function, create `supabase/functions/webhook-evolution/index.ts` with
  the Deno-specific imports (serve from 'std/server') and the implementation
  shown in the original scaffold. Then run:

    supabase functions deploy webhook-evolution

  Or use the Supabase web UI to create the function.

// DENO edge function implementation intentionally omitted here to avoid
// TypeScript compile errors in the Node-based project environment.
