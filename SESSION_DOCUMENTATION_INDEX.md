## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS QUICK REFERENCE

### createHttpHandler Pattern
```typescript
export const GET = createHttpHandler(
  async (ctx) => {
    // Your business logic here
    return { data };
  },
  'GET',  // HTTP method
  { auth: true, roles: ['owner'] }  // Options
);
```

### Available Context (ctx)
- `ctx.user` - Authenticated user { id, tenantId, role, email }
- `ctx.supabase` - Supabase client (fully authenticated)
- `ctx.request` - Next.js Request object
- `ctx.params` - Route parameters (if applicable)

### Error Factory
```typescript
ApiErrorFactory.badRequest('Message')    // 400
ApiErrorFactory.unauthorized('Message')   // 401
ApiErrorFactory.forbidden('Message')      // 403
ApiErrorFactory.notFound('Message')       // 404
ApiErrorFactory.conflict('Message')       // 409
ApiErrorFactory.internal('Message')       // 500
// Plus 4 more for specific use cases
```

### Success Pattern
```typescript
// Instead of: return NextResponse.json(data);
// Use: return { data };  // handler manages response
```
